# Summary

PLEASE SEE LATEST UPDATE BELOW!

This is my design for a print-as-one (print-in-place) hinged tablet stand that can be adjusted over a wide range of incline angles.  I was looking around on thingiverse for something of this nature but could only find adjustable ones that need screws and nuts to assemble, or some other post-print assembly.  I thought there must be a better way!

This will work straight off the print bed.  Just peel away the brim and VERY CAREFULLY loosen the hinges and you're good to go. I've been using it with a large 9.7" Galaxy Tab S2 with a case on and it supports it nicely and feels very stable.

When you first unfold it, the inner two parts have to swing all the way round the outer base piece so that it brings the supports on to the top side of the base where the position notches are located.  Then to put it away flat, just rotate all the way round to the back again.

There may well be a few improvements that could be made to the design, but I would welcome any comments and suggestions!  At the moment, the supports are spaced a little too wide to use for my Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone, so I have considered maybe a smaller version to accommodate phones as well.  Not sure if the narrower design would become unstable for large tablets though.

###  UPDATE - 14 Oct 2017 ###
I've now uploaded a narrower version that will support a smartphone.  I haven't printed it myself yet, but the tolerances are all the same so it should work out fine.  Let me know how you get on with it!

### UPDATE - 02 Sep 2018 ###
Big thanks to @pjyarnall for sending me his modified design for my tablet stand, there's now an updated version for you to download that has improved tolerances and hinges for easier printing without binding.  There is also an enlarged hook to accommodate thicker tablet cases. Download the file called py_tablet_stand_assembly.stl.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: Prusa Clone
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.1mm
Infill: 30%

Notes: 
I printed with a 10mm brim to ensure good adhesion.

# How I Designed This

I designed this using Creo Parametric as an assembly of three parts, to ensure the correct tolerances in the printed hinges and then created an STL file from the folded assembly.
